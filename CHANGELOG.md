## [v7.3.0] - 2026-01-14

### New Features
- **HDR10 Conversion:** New `-hdr10` flag for `-convert` to convert to HDR10 instead of Dolby Vision profile 8.1. Retains HDR10+ metadata if present in the source. Useful for Complex FEL files where you want to prevent devices like the Shield from converting to 8.1 when it shouldn't. Read the docs for more info.

- **Scan Filter:** New `-candidates` flag for `-scan` to show only files that can be converted, filtering out SDR, HDR10, Profile 8, etc. Useful for quickly identifying conversion targets in large libraries.


### Changed
- Cleaned up `-help` message formatting.
- `-scan` now displays a clear message when no MKV files are found instead of an empty table.


## [v7.2.0] - 2026-01-12

### New Features
- **Custom Output Directory:** New `-o` flag to specify a custom output directory for converted files (`-convert file.mkv -o /output`). Works with `-convert` and `-batch`. Read docs for more info. (Ref #4)

### Changed
- Improved error messages when tools like mkvmerge or mediainfo fail.
- Improved `-debug` logging
- If more than 50% of probes fail during -scan, we now treat it as an error and exit.


## [v7.1.0] - 2026-01-07

### Breaking Change
- **Batch Recursion Syntax:** The shorthand `-batch 2` no longer works. Use `-batch -r 2` instead, matching `-scan` and `-cleanup`.

### New Features
- **Multi-File Convert:** Convert multiple files in one command (`-convert file1.mkv file2.mkv`). Works with wildcards (`-convert *.mkv`). A summary is displayed at the end.
- **Target Directories:** Point `-scan` or `-batch` at specific directories instead of navigating there first (`-batch /movies`). Multiple directories are supported (`-scan /movies /tv`).
- **Recursive with Directories:** The `-r` flag works with target directories (`-batch /movies -r 3`).
- **Mixed Inputs for Scan:** Combine files and directories in a single `-scan` command (`-scan /movies file.mkv`).
- **Temp Directory:** New `-temp` flag to redirect intermediate files to a fast drive (SSD). This dramatically improves conversion speed when source files are on slow storage like HDDs or network shares. Example: `-convert movie.mkv -temp /mnt/ssd`. Works with `-convert` and `-batch`. 
- **Directory Grouping:** Recursive scans now group files by directory with clear headers, making it easier to see which files belong where. 

### Changed
- **Docker:** The container no longer modifies permissions on bind-mounted directories. Users must ensure their `PUID`/`PGID` matches the ownership of their files (standard Docker practice).
- **Docker:** Users can now bind-mount a temp directory for the new `-temp` feature. Example: `-v /mnt/ssd:/cache` then use `-temp /cache`.


## [v7.0.1] - 2026-01-04
### Fixed
- **Better Error Handling:** Fixed a bug where temporary files were not deleted if the script exited due to a conversion error (Ref #21).

### Changed
- **Conversion Verification:** Implemented a fallback mechanism for frame verification. If `MediaInfo` reports a frame mismatch (common with inaccurate source metadata), the script now double-checks using `ffprobe` stream analysis before failing (Ref #21).
- **WSL Path Limit:** Improved handling of long file paths in WSL, which can exceed the 255 character limit (Ref #14).
- **Windows:** Improved exiting on native Windows (WSL required) (Ref #22).

## [v7.0.0] - 2026-01-03 (Stable Release)

> **This is a major release.** The tool has been completely rewritten in Python, replacing the original Bash script.

### Breaking Changes
- **Python 3.8+ is now required.** The Bash version is no longer maintained.
- **Dependencies changed:** Removed `jq`, `bc`, `curl`. The script now only requires Python and core media tools.
- **Docker:** The `:beta` tag will be deprecated. Switch to `:latest`.

### Highlights (from Beta Cycle)
- **Complete Python rewrite** for improved maintainability and cross-platform compatibility.
- **5x faster** RPU analysis (`-inspect`) due to native Python processing with streaming parser.
- **Reduced dependencies** — no more shell utilities like `jq`, `bc`, `curl`, `sed`, `awk`, or `grep`.
- **Improved error handling** — better detection of tool failures and MediaInfo issues.
- **WSL Required** — Native Windows is explicitly blocked. Windows users must use WSL2 or Docker.

### Fixed (since beta5)
- Process safety improvements for `-inspect` command.

### Note for Docker Users
If you were using the `:beta` tag, please update to `:latest`. The `:beta` tag will be removed after a transition period.

---

## [v7.0.0-beta5] - 2026-01-01
### Fixed
- **Process Safety:** Fixed an issue where the `-inspect` command could potentially give a false "safe" verdict if one of the internal tools crashed silently. It now correctly reports a failure in this scenario.

### Changed
- **Internal Optimization:** Refactored core analysis commands to improve stability and make future feature updates safer.
- **Error Handling:** Improved detection and handling of MediaInfo-related issues.
- **Windows:** Added a hard error message when running on Native Windows (WSL required). Native Windows is not supported.
- **UI:** Removed misleading "(Slow)" label from export step and improved color contrast in scan advisory.

## [v7.0.0-beta4] - 2026-01-01
### Changed
- Significantly reduced memory usage and improved speed during `-inspect` analysis (Streaming Parser).

## [v7.0.0-beta3] - 2025-12-30
### Changed
- Improved Docker container compatibility (Temporary files now use bind-mount).

## [v6.6.5] - 2025-12-30
### Changed
- Improved Docker container compatibility (Temporary files now use bind-mount).
## [v7.0.0-beta2] - 2024-12-30
### Fixed
- **Interactive Batch Exclusion:** Responding "No" to the "Include Simple-FEL" prompt now correctly filters those files from the queue instead of cancelling the entire batch.
- **Ctrl+C Handling:** Fixed an issue where the script would hang if interrupted during batch mode prompts.
- **Redundant Prompts:** Fixed an issue where Simple-FEL files would trigger a confirmation prompt for every single file even after being approved at the batch start.

### Changed
- **Terminology:** Updated batch warning messages to refer to `-scan` instead of `-check`.
- **Messaging:** Improved clarity of Simple-FEL inclusion messages ("Explicitly included").

## [v7.0.0-beta1] - 2024-12-30 (Public Beta)
### Python Rewrite & Performance
- **Rewritten from scratch:** The entire tool has been rewritten in Python, replacing the original Bash script.
    - **Why?** To ensure future maintainability, improve stability, and allow for more new features in the future (Bash was getting out of hand).
- **Performance:** RPU analysis (`-inspect`) is **5x faster** due to native Python processing.
- **Dependencies:** Removed `jq`, `bc`, `curl`, `sed`, `awk`, `grep`. The script now only uses the standard library and core media tools (`ffmpeg`, etc.).
- **Parity:** Functionally identical to the v6 Bash version.


## [6.6.4] - 2025-12-28
### Added
- **New `-scan` command** - A better-named alias for `-check`. Both commands work identically. `-check` remains supported for backwards compatibility.

### Changed
- README completely rewritten for clarity and structure.
- All "deep scan" terminology replaced with "scan" throughout the script.
- macOS: Homebrew no longer required if all dependencies are already installed.
- macOS: Added guidance for users without Homebrew during dependency check.
- dovi_tool install instructions now link to main repo page.

## [6.6.3] - 2025-12-26
### Fixed
- Fixed `-include-simple` flag not suppressing per-file Simple FEL prompts during batch runs (Fixes #5).

## [6.6.2] - 2025-12-26
### Changed
- Cleanup release: Updated internal help text to better reflect features and changes from recent versions.

## [6.6.1] - 2025-12-25
### Fixed
- Fixed `jq` errors when scanning directories containing macOS resource fork files.
- Fixed random "File not found" errors and corrupted filenames during recursive scans.
- Scan commands now fully exclude macOS resource fork artifacts (`._*` files and folders).

### Changed
- Improved color theme of the -check output to better distinguish between different file types.
- Recursive scans now display filenames only (not folder paths) for cleaner output.

## [6.6] - 2025-12-25

### Added
- **Automatic Update Check:** The tool now silently checks for updates in the background without slowing down execution (Zero-Latency). If a new version is found, a notification is displayed on the *next* run.
- **Manual Update Check:** Added `-update-check` command to manually check for the latest version and report status immediately.
- **Automatic Dependency Installation (Beta):** If dependencies are missing, the tool now offers to install them automatically. Supports Homebrew (macOS), apt (Ubuntu/Debian), dnf (Fedora), and pacman (Arch).
- **Simple FEL Warning:** The `-convert` command now prompts for confirmation when processing Simple FEL files to match the safety behavior of batch mode.

### Changed
- **Dependencies:** Added `curl` to the list of required dependencies (standard on most systems).

## [6.5.1] - 2025-12-24
### Added
- Batch output now displays separate counts for MEL and Simple FEL files.
- Added warnings when "Simple FEL" files are detected in batch mode.
- `-include-simple` flag to allow automated processing of "Simple FEL" files in batch mode.
- Added context to the check command explaining "Simple FEL" results.

### Changed
- Improved detection logic to be more robust and accurate.
- Improved handling of titles mastered at 4000 nits.
- Batch mode now defaults to pausing if "Simple FEL" files are found, even with `-y`.
- Updated help text descriptions for clarity.

## [6.5] - 2025-12-22
### Added
- **Deep Scan FEL Detection**: New analysis logic that inspects the RPU structure to deterministically identify "Complex" FEL titles (e.g. FEL that elevates luminance and shouldn't be converted to profile 8.1).
- **`-force` Flag**: Override safety warnings for Complex FEL titles (e.g., `dovi_convert -convert movie.mkv -force`). Works for single file and batch mode.
- **Improved Batch Summary**: Batch mode now tracks "Ignored" (Not Profile 7), "Skipped" (Unsafe), and "Converted" files separately. It also distinguishes between "Simple" and "Forced" conversions in the final report.
- **`-inspect` Command**: New standalone tool to inspect full RPU structure and verify Complex FEL verdicts by checking the entire file's brightness metadata.

### Changed
- **Default Behavior**: `-check` now performs a Deep Scan on Profile 7 files by default.
- **Strict Enforcement**: The tool now hard-fails if the input file is not Dolby Vision Profile 7 (removed interactive prompts for non-P7 files).
- **Safe Mode UI**: Progress numbering aligned to standard workflow (`[1/3] Extracting`, `[1/3] Converting`) for consistency.
- **Arguments**: Arguments can now be passed in any order. Fixed `-r` argument parsing logic.
- **Safety**: Conversion now defaults to skipping/warning on Complex FELs to prevent data loss.

## [6.4.2] - 2025-12-19
### Added
- **Piping Implementation:** Standard conversion now pipes `ffmpeg` output directly to `dovi_tool`. This eliminates temporary disk usage for the video stream and improves processing speed.
- **Batch Summary:** The `-batch` command scans the directory and displays total file count and size before requesting confirmation.
- **Smart Fallback:** Added logic to detect specific stream errors (often caused by Seamless Branching) and offer Safe Mode as a retry option.
- **Debug Logging:** Added `-debug` flag to write full tool output to `dovi_convert_debug.log` for troubleshooting.
- **Global `-y` Flag:** Added support for auto-confirming interactive prompts (batch start and cleanup).
- **Metrics:** Script now reports space saved (EL discarded) and average FPS upon completion.

### Changed
- **Cleanup Scope:** `-cleanup` now defaults to non-recursive scanning. Added `-r` flag to enable recursive mode.
- **Cleanup UI:** The command now lists all files to be deleted before asking for confirmation.
- **UI:** Replaced static text with a spinner for progress indication.
- **Validation:** Added strict argument parsing to prevent syntax errors.

## [6.3]
### Added
- Initial public release.
