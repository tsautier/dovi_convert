**Convert Dolby Vision Profile 7 MKV files to Profile 8.1 for universal playback compatibility.**

## Why?

Most streaming devices (Apple TV, Shield, Amazon Fire*, etc.) don't support Profile 7's Enhancement Layer. They either fall back to HDR10 or blindly strip the layer, potentially ruining the picture.

**dovi_convert** analyzes files first, converts only what's safe, and preserves dynamic metadata for correct Dolby Vision playback.

## What's New (v8.2)

Version 8.2 finally introduces the Backup & Restore feature. It allows you to backup the Dolby Vision enhancement layer before or during a conversion. You can then delete the original file and, as long as you keep the converted file, restore the original at any time using the backed up EL. Benefits: Save tons of disk space. Instead of keeping the original file around, you just store the enhancement layer, which is much smaller. 


Make sure to read the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

chmod +x dovi_convert.py && sudo mv dovi_convert.py /usr/local/bin/dovi_convert
```

### Docker

#### docker run

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name=dovi_convert \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/Berlin \
  -p 7681:7681 \
  -v /path/to/media:/data \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  cryptochrome/dovi_convert:latest
```

#### docker-compose.yml

```yaml
services:
  dovi_convert:
    image: cryptochrome/dovi_convert:latest
    container_name: dovi_convert
    environment:
      - PUID=1000 # Change to required User ID, if needed
      - PGID=1000 # Change to required Group ID, if needed
      - TZ=Europe/Berlin # Change to your timezone
    volumes:
      - /path/to/media:/data # Change to your media directory
    ports:
      - 7681:7681 # Change left port to your desired port (e. g. 8080:7681)
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Access the web terminal at `http://<your-docker-host>:7681`.

## Basic Usage

```bash
dovi_convert scan                     # Analyze files in current directory
dovi_convert convert Movie.mkv        # Convert a single file
dovi_convert convert /path/to/media   # Batch convert directory
```

## Before You Convert

- Not all Profile 7 files should be converted. Some use the Enhancement Layer for brightness expansion, which causes incorrect tone mapping if removed.
- The tool detects these "Complex FEL" files and skips them by default. Don't use `--force` unless you understand the consequences.
- FEL can also contain film grain, noise, and color data. Retaining this data during conversion requires re-encoding, which is out of scope. Your player can't decode FEL anyway, so this data is already inaccessible. You do retain the Dolby Vision dynamic metadata (RPU).
- Original files are backed up automatically. The `--delete` flag removes them permanently.
- Read [Before You Start](https://docs.doviconvert.com/before-you-start) for the full explanation.
